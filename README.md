Yet another personal finance management service. It is open source and installed in local so you
don't have to wrorry about the
security issue. I understand it is tedious to download the transactions and import but
everything is trade-off. And I think we could still add the api to each bank later if
we really need the auto-import.

Anyway it is still in progress.
